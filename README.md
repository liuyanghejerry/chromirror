## Chromirror

A mirror for downloading latest Google Chrome standalone installer.

This should be useful when you have problem access Google's sites, such as in mainland China.

node index.js
```

Generally, `http://localhost:3000/download` will serve an installer, and the installer should be updated every 5min.

* More configs.
* Friendly web interface.
* More Chrome versions.
